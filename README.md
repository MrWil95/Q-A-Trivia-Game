# Project Overview

## Project Name

Q&A Trivia Game

## Project Description

The end goal, here, is to build a trivia game that will test the players' knowledge on different categories. I will impliment buttons for the player to click in order to select the right answer to any given question. There will be a points system incorporated along with a timer function. I am going to add a menu with a start button to trigger the timer and start the test, a difficulty setting will be added to spice things up a bit, and a category section to get some juicy topics. The more questions that are answered correctly the higher your score will go. If the score is more than x when the timer is done, display "congratulations!" otherwise display "sorry, better luck next time." Before the trivia begins player must enter name. At the end of the game you will get the option to start over or select category
