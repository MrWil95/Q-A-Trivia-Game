# Project Overview

## Project Name

Q&A Trivia Game

## Project Description

The end goal, here, is to build a trivia game that will test the players' knowledge on different categories. I will impliment buttons for the player to click in order to select the right answer to any given question. There will be a points system incorporated along with a timer function. I am going to add a menu with a start button to trigger the timer and start the test, a difficulty setting will be added to spice things up a bit, and a category section to get some juicy topics. The more questions that are answered correctly the higher your score will go. If the score is more than x when the timer is done, display "congratulations!" otherwise display "sorry, better luck next time." Before the trivia begins player must enter name. At the end of the game you will get the option to start over or select category

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.  

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Adding Form | H | 3hrs| 3.5hrs | 3.5hrs |
| Working with API | H | 3hrs| 2.5hrs | 2.5hrs |
| Total | H | 6hrs| 5hrs | 5hrs |
