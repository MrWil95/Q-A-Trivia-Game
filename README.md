# Project Overview

## Project Name

LOTR Trivia

## Project Description

The end goal, here, is to build a site that will test the average "nerd's" knowledge on everything The Lord of the Rings. I will impliment buttons for the player to click in order to select the right answer to any given question. There will be a points system incorporated along with a timer function. I am going to add a menu with a start button to trigger the timer. The more questions that are answered correctly the higher your score will go. If the score is more than x when the timer is done, display "congratulations!" otherwise display "sorry, better luck next time." Before the trivia begins player must enter name. Puzzles and interactive activity will be added.

### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 
*These are examples only. Replace with your own MVP features.*

- On button.click {
	-test start
	-timer start
	-answer generated/assesed
	-animation start
}
- timer count down
- Points system incrementation when answer = true 
- when timer = 00:00 end game
- if questions answered === x end game display congratulations, perfect score!
- if questions correct > x when timer ends display congratulations!
- responsive style
- animations
 

#### PostMVP  
*These are examples only. Replace with your own Post-MVP features.*

- Add second API
- Add puzzles and interactive games
- Add data storage

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.  

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

|  Day | Deliverable | Status
|---|---| ---|
|July 10-12| Prompt / Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Timeframes | Incomplete
|July 13| Project Approval | Incomplete
|July 13| Core Application Structure (HTML, CSS, etc.) | Incomplete
|July 14| Pseudocode / actual code | Incomplete
|July 15| Initial Clickable Model  | Incomplete
|July 16| MVP | Incomplete
|July 17| Presentations | Incomplete

## Priority Matrix

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Importance` Matrix.  Link this image in a similar manner to your wireframes

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Adding Form | H | 3hrs| 3.5hrs | 3.5hrs |
| Working with API | H | 3hrs| 2.5hrs | 2.5hrs |
| Total | H | 6hrs| 5hrs | 5hrs |
